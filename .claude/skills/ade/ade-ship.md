## Phase 9 — SHIP
1. Stage relevant files (NOT .env, credentials, unrelated changes)
2. Commit with conventional message (imperative mood, max 72 chars)
3. Push to feature branch
4. Open PR with:
   - Summary (1-3 bullets)
   - Use Cases (UC IDs)
   - Test Plan (checklist)
   - Visual Verification (screenshots for UI changes)
   - Before/After Evidence (bugfixes only)
5. Upload verification screenshots as PR comment via `gh pr comment`

**Exit criteria:** PR created. URL returned to user.

## ◆ MERGE GATE
Present PR to user for review and merge decision.
The agent creates the PR. The human merges it.

- Circuit breaker triggers
- What worked, what didn't
- Follow-up items

Clean up worktree: `git worktree remove .ade/worktrees/<task-id>`
