Run ADE planning phases (Intent + Research + Plan) for: $ARGUMENTS

Follow Phases 0-2 of the ADE workflow.

## Phase 0 — INTENT
Extract structured requirements: type, goal, acceptance criteria, affected areas, scope.
Save to `.ade/tasks/<task-id>/intent.md`.
For bugs: also run QA Verify — reproduce on live system with evidence.
**Exit criteria:** Goal and acceptance criteria clearly stated.

## Phase 1 — RESEARCH
Launch up to 3 Explore agents in parallel:
1. Existing implementation — files, functions, execution paths
2. Related patterns — how similar features work elsewhere
3. Reusable utilities — shared helpers, hooks, components

**Hard requirement:** Research well enough to propose an approach.
**Preferred mechanism:** 3 parallel Explore agents.
**Allowed fallback:** Manual investigation covering same scopes.
**Exit criteria:** Findings presented to user with proposed approach.

## ◆ USER GATE
STOP. Present findings. Get explicit approval before proceeding.

## Phase 2 — PLAN
Write implementation plan to `.ade/tasks/<task-id>/plan.md` with 6 sections:
Context, Ordered task list, Files to create/modify, Dependencies, Test strategy, Risk areas.

**Hard requirement:** Plan specific enough to execute without ambiguity.
**Exit criteria:** Plan file written with all 6 sections.

## ◆ PLAN GATE
Verify plan exists and is complete. Do NOT proceed if incomplete.

Update `.ade/tasks/<task-id>/status.md` at each phase transition.
